- web essenstials (HTML, CSS, JS) 
- JQuery

  - authentication
  - zero-configuration hosting, with SSL
  - database backend.

## How It Works

Firebase is a Google acquisition that provides a BEaaS (Back End as a Service) for mobile and web applications. There are several products in that portfolio, however this project using the hosting, authentication, and database components.

As such, this application sidesteps the need for middleware by allowing the client to communicate directly to the database. The web application is designed to work only after a user has authenticated; at which time, their account is granted read/write access to the database. Ultimately, however, administrative user had the capability delete records, and perform other destructive actions.
